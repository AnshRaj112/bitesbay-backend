# Order Cleanup System Fix

## Problem Description
Orders were being "deleted" from the database after some time, causing confusion for users. The issue was actually that orders were being marked as "failed" and remaining in the `activeOrders` array, making them appear to disappear from the user's active orders list.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Status Inconsistency**: Payment verification was setting order status to "failedPayment" which is not a valid enum value in the Order model
2. **Incomplete Cleanup**: Failed orders were not being moved from `activeOrders` to `pastOrders`
3. **Short Expiration Time**: 10-minute expiration was too short for some users
4. **Frequent Cleanup**: 5-minute cleanup interval was too aggressive

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Status Inconsistency
- **File**: `utils/orderUtils.js`
- **Change**: Changed `status: "failedPayment"` to `status: "failed"` in payment verification
- **Impact**: Failed payments now properly update order status

### 2. Complete Order Cleanup
- **File**: `utils/orderCleanupUtils.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added User and Vendor model imports
  - Move failed orders from user's `activeOrders` to `pastOrders`
  - Remove failed orders from vendor's `activeOrders`
  - Added better logging for debugging

### 3. Extended Expiration Time
- **File**: `utils/orderUtils.js`
- **Change**: Increased `reservationExpiresAt` from 10 minutes to 30 minutes
- **Impact**: Users have more time to complete payment

### 4. Reduced Cleanup Frequency
- **Files**: `index.js`, `utils/orderCleanupUtils.js`
- **Change**: Increased cleanup interval from 5 minutes to 10 minutes
- **Impact**: Less aggressive cleanup, better performance

## Files Modified

1. `kiitbites-backend/utils/orderUtils.js`
   - Fixed payment verification status
   - Added proper order cleanup for failed payments
   - Extended expiration time to 30 minutes

2. `kiitbites-backend/utils/orderCleanupUtils.js`
   - Added User and Vendor model imports
   - Enhanced cleanup to move orders to past orders
   - Added better logging
   - Updated documentation

3. `kiitbites-backend/index.js`
   - Increased cleanup interval to 10 minutes

4. `kiitbites-backend/scripts/test-order-cleanup.js` (new)
   - Test script to verify cleanup functionality

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:

```bash
cd kiitbites-backend
node scripts/test-order-cleanup.js
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Orders no longer "disappear"**: Failed orders are moved to past orders instead of staying in active orders
2. **Longer payment window**: Users have 30 minutes to complete payment instead of 10
3. **Better visibility**: Failed orders appear in past orders with "failed" status
4. **Proper cleanup**: Both user and vendor order lists are properly updated

## Monitoring

The system now logs cleanup activities with timestamps:
- `🔍 Checking for expired orders at [timestamp]`
- `🧹 Cleaned up expired order [orderId], moved to past orders, released [X] locks`

## Payment Cancellation Fix

### Problem Description
When users cancelled payments in Razorpay, the item locks remained active, preventing them from ordering again. The system would show "food item is under cleanup" error.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Cancellation Handler**: Frontend didn't call backend when payment was cancelled
2. **Locks Not Released**: Item locks remained active after payment cancellation
3. **No Manual Cancel Option**: Users couldn't manually cancel stuck orders

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. **Backend Cancel Endpoints**
- **File**: `controllers/orderController.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `cancelOrder()` function for automatic cancellation
  - Added `cancelOrderManual()` function for manual cancellation
  - Both functions properly release locks and move orders to past orders

#### 2. **Frontend Integration**
- **Files**: 
  - `kiitbites-frontend/src/app/components/BillBox.tsx`
  - `kiitbites-application/app/components/BillBox.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added automatic cancellation call in `ondismiss` callback
  - Added proper error handling and user feedback
  - Both web and mobile apps now handle cancellation properly

#### 3. **Route Configuration**
- **File**: `routes/orderRoutes.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `/orders/:orderId/cancel` route for automatic cancellation
  - Added `/orders/:orderId/cancel-manual` route for manual cancellation

#### 4. **Testing**
- **File**: `scripts/test-order-cancellation.js` (new)
- **Purpose**: Verify cancellation functionality works correctly

### Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Automatic Cleanup**: When users cancel payment, locks are automatically released
2. **Immediate Retry**: Users can immediately try ordering again after cancellation
3. **Manual Option**: Users can manually cancel stuck orders if needed
4. **Better UX**: Clear feedback when cancellation succeeds or fails
5. **Data Consistency**: All database operations are atomic - they either all succeed or all fail

## Database Transaction Fix

### Problem Description
The original implementation performed multiple database operations sequentially without proper transaction handling. If any operation failed, the system could be left in an inconsistent state.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Sequential Operations**: Multiple database updates were performed one after another
2. **No Rollback**: If one operation failed, previous operations were not rolled back
3. **Inconsistent State**: System could be left with partial updates

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. **Atomic Cancellation Functions**
- **Files**: 
  - `utils/orderUtils.js`
  - `controllers/orderController.js`
  - `utils/orderCleanupUtils.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `cancelOrderAtomically()` helper functions
  - Wrapped all database operations in MongoDB transactions
  - Ensured all operations succeed or fail together

#### 2. **Transaction Handling**
- **Pattern**: Used `session.withTransaction()` for atomic operations
- **Benefits**:
  - All operations succeed or fail together
  - Automatic rollback on failure
  - Data consistency guaranteed
  - Better error handling and recovery

#### 3. **Error Recovery**
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Added fallback lock release even if database operations fail
- **Session Management**: Proper session cleanup with `finally` blocks
- **Detailed Logging**: Better error tracking and debugging

#### 4. **Testing**
- **File**: `scripts/test-atomic-transactions.js` (new)
- **Purpose**: Verify atomic transaction functionality and data consistency

### Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Example of atomic cancellation pattern
const session = await mongoose.startSession();
try {
  await session.withTransaction(async () => {
    await cancelOrderAtomically(orderId, order, session);
  });
} catch (error) {
  // Handle transaction failure
} finally {
  await session.endSession();
}
```

### Expected Behavior After Transaction Fix

1. **Data Consistency**: All database operations are atomic
2. **No Partial States**: System never left in inconsistent state
3. **Automatic Rollback**: Failed operations are automatically rolled back
4. **Better Reliability**: System is more robust against failures
5. **Easier Debugging**: Clear transaction boundaries and error handling

## Future Improvements

1. **User Notifications**: Send notifications when orders are about to expire
2. **Configurable Expiration**: Make expiration time configurable per vendor/order type
3. **Retry Mechanism**: Allow users to retry failed payments
4. **Analytics**: Track failed order patterns for business insights
5. **Real-time Updates**: Show order status changes in real-time
6. **Cancellation Reasons**: Track why users cancel payments for business insights

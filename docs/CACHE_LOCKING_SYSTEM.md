# Cache Locking System Documentation

## Overview

The Cache Locking System is an in-memory solution that prevents race conditions in the ordering system by implementing atomic operations similar to Lua scripts. It ensures that when multiple users try to order the same items simultaneously, only one user can proceed while others are blocked until the first user completes or abandons their order.

## Problem Solved

**Race Condition Issue**: When two users click "order" at the same time for the last available item, both were able to place orders because there was no reservation system.

**Solution**: Implement atomic locks that temporarily reserve items when a user places an order, preventing other users from accessing the same items until the first user completes payment or the lock expires.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AtomicCache Class** (`utils/cacheUtils.js`)
   - In-memory cache with atomic operations
   - Lock management with TTL (Time To Live)
   - Automatic cleanup of expired locks

2. **Order Processing Integration** (`utils/orderUtils.js`)
   - Integrates locks into the order creation process
   - Releases locks on errors or successful payment

3. **Payment Processing Integration** (`controllers/paymentController.js`)
   - Releases locks after successful payment verification
   - Handles lock cleanup for failed payments

4. **Cleanup System** (`utils/orderCleanupUtils.js`)
   - Periodic cleanup of expired orders and locks
   - Manual cleanup utilities for admin use

5. **Admin Management** (`routes/adminRoutes.js`)
   - Monitoring and management endpoints
   - Statistics and manual lock operations

## How It Works

### 1. Order Placement Process

```javascript
// When user places an order:
1. User calls placeOrder API
2. System attempts to acquire locks for all items in cart
3. If any item is already locked â†’ return error
4. If all locks acquired â†’ proceed with order creation
5. If order creation fails â†’ release all locks
6. If order creation succeeds â†’ locks remain until payment
```

### 2. Payment Process

```javascript
// When payment is processed:
1. User completes payment
2. System verifies payment signature
3. If payment succeeds â†’ release all locks + process inventory
4. If payment fails â†’ release all locks + mark order as failed
```

### 3. Lock Expiration

```javascript
// Automatic cleanup:
1. Locks have 5-minute TTL by default
2. Periodic cleanup runs every 5 minutes
3. Expired orders are marked as failed
4. Associated locks are automatically released
```

## API Endpoints

### Order Placement
- **POST** `/order/:userId` - Places order with automatic locking

### Payment Verification
- **POST** `/payment/verify` - Verifies payment and releases locks

### Admin Management
- **GET** `/admin/locks/stats` - Get lock statistics
- **POST** `/admin/locks/release/:orderId` - Force release locks for order
- **POST** `/admin/locks/cleanup` - Manual cleanup trigger
- **POST** `/admin/locks/clear-all` - Emergency: clear all locks
- **GET** `/admin/locks/items/:itemId` - Get lock info for specific item

## Configuration

### Lock TTL (Time To Live)
- **Default**: 5 minutes (300,000 ms)
- **Configurable**: In `cacheUtils.js` - `acquireLock()` function
- **Recommended**: 5-10 minutes based on payment processing time

### Cleanup Intervals
- **Lock Cleanup**: Every 30 seconds (automatic)
- **Order Cleanup**: Every 5 minutes (automatic)
- **Configurable**: In `index.js` - `startPeriodicCleanup()`

## Usage Examples

### Basic Lock Operations

```javascript
const { atomicCache } = require('./utils/cacheUtils');

// Acquire lock
const lockAcquired = atomicCache.acquireLock('item123', 'user456', 300000);

// Check if locked
const isLocked = atomicCache.isLocked('item123');

// Release lock
const released = atomicCache.releaseLock('item123', 'user456');
```

### Cart Reservation

```javascript
const cartItems = [
  { itemId: 'item1', kind: 'Retail', quantity: 2 },
  { itemId: 'item2', kind: 'Produce', quantity: 1 }
];

const result = await atomicCache.reserveItemsInCart(cartItems, 'user123', 'vendor456');
if (result.success) {
  // Proceed with order
} else {
  // Handle failed reservation
  console.log('Failed items:', result.failedItems);
}
```

### Admin Operations

```javascript
// Get statistics
const stats = await getLockStatistics();
console.log('Active locks:', stats.activeLocks);

// Force release locks for order
const result = await forceReleaseOrderLocks('orderId123');

// Manual cleanup
const cleanup = await cleanupExpiredOrders();
```

## Testing

### Run Test Suite
```bash
npm run test-locks
```

### Test Coverage
- Basic lock acquisition and release
- Cart reservation simulation
- Lock expiration
- Concurrent access prevention
- Statistics and monitoring

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Logs to Watch
```
ðŸ”’ Cache locking system initialized with periodic cleanup
Cleaned up 3 expired locks
Periodic cleanup: Cleaned up 2 expired orders and released 5 locks
```

### Common Issues

1. **Locks Not Releasing**
   - Check if payment verification is completing
   - Verify cleanup is running
   - Use admin endpoints to force release

2. **High Lock Count**
   - Monitor `/admin/locks/stats`
   - Check for stuck orders
   - Review cleanup logs

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor lock acquisition times
   - Check for lock contention
   - Consider adjusting TTL values

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always handle lock release in error scenarios
2. Use appropriate TTL values for your use case
3. Monitor lock statistics regularly
4. Test concurrent scenarios thoroughly

### For Operations
1. Monitor lock statistics via admin endpoints
2. Set up alerts for high lock counts
3. Regular review of cleanup logs
4. Have emergency procedures for lock clearing

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage
- Each lock: ~200 bytes
- 1000 active locks: ~200KB
- Minimal impact on overall memory

### Speed
- Lock acquisition: <1ms
- Lock release: <1ms
- Cart reservation: <5ms for typical carts

### Scalability
- Supports thousands of concurrent locks
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Horizontal scaling possible with shared cache

## Security Considerations

1. **Lock Ownership**: Only the user who acquired a lock can release it
2. **Admin Access**: Admin endpoints should be protected with authentication
3. **TTL Protection**: Locks automatically expire to prevent deadlocks
4. **Audit Trail**: All lock operations are logged

## Future Enhancements

1. **Distributed Locks**: Support for multiple server instances
2. **Lock Queuing**: Queue system for high-contention items
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed lock usage analytics
4. **WebSocket Notifications**: Real-time lock status updates
5. **Machine Learning**: Predictive lock management

## Troubleshooting

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Clear All Locks** (Use with caution):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/admin/locks/clear-all
   ```

2. **Force Release Specific Order**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/admin/locks/release/orderId123
   ```

3. **Manual Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/admin/locks/cleanup
   ```

### Common Error Messages

- `"Item is currently being processed by another user"` - Normal lock contention
- `"Failed to release locks"` - Check order status and retry
- `"Lock not found"` - Lock may have expired or been cleared
